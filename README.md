### Analysis
- The data shows there was a total of 5,074,502 trips made between October to December 2020, taken using 20,793 bikes. 
- The total start stations was 1,181 and the total End Stations were 1,203 
- A majority of the users were subscribers (3,985,140) compared to casual users (1,089,362)
- Note there were outliers in the data. The 'Age and Gender' users chart was filtered to exclude unknown users and the chart ended at age 90. Data past this age was likely incorrect reporting of users. 
- Most common age of users for both men and women was 30 years old

- While the number of End Stations are more than than the number of Start Stations, the End Stations are clustered closer together and less spread out.
